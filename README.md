It was fun to work on the problem, the hardest part wasn't creating the logic, the hardest part was fixing the smallest mistakes related to memory allocation, buffers and such.
strlen function was kind enough to cause me to loose hours just to release in the end that it doesn't account for the null character at the end of the string and that was the problem that I needed to account for, it shows why no one likes c. The good thing that came out of it is having the chance to refine my skill in isolating the problem, making the research needed and fixing it.
